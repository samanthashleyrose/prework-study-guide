## Description

If you're looking for Uconn's Bootcamp Need-To-Knows, you've come to the right place. The intention for this project was to create an organized website containing helpful learning information for myself and others to be able to reach in one convenient location. Using HTML, CSS, GIT, and JS I was able to create a sleek yet functional design making the user's ability to interact with the site seamless.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

 The site has multiple sections displaying definitions, facts, and/or examples pertaining to the section's subject.  Using Chrome's DevTools console, you can access an interactive menu suggesting which subject to start with! (use command+option+I for mac0S or Control+Shift+I for Windows)
